# Hura Ayuda - ShellHacks 2024 Project

The recent catastrophic hurricane Helene, which swept through Florida in September 2024, inspired us to launch a website dedicated to delivering up-to-date hurricane safety information. We believe that having access to this information can help save lives and safeguard communities from the devastation caused by hurricanes. 





## Features

- Using the Google maps API to take in the user's location and map out the nearest storm shelters located, calculating both the distance in miles and time in minutes
- Hurricane Preparedness Checklist
- live Hurricane Tracker using an API from Windy
- Latest Hurricane News
